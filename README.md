# The m.io project
The goal of the m.io project is to create an open source Moomoo.io server implementation. Currently m.io does not work as a private server as it is still in development. m.io is avalible as an npm package, but the package will not be updated until m.io is able to act as a basic server implementation.

# Directory roadmap
`src/` - The server source code<br>
`tests/` - Test scripts<br>
`packetAnalyzer` - A userscript that is able to capture and log traffic between the Moomoo.io server and client
